AmazingArk looks like it had a damn fine first week.\\n\\nSwitch and Mario are still incredible results on Media Create.Sony is officially with zero big titles in Japan.Switch and Mario are monsters, pleasantly surprised at Strange Journey. Good for Atlus.MC doesn't include download card sales right? makes sense why mario is below 500k then2M LTD for Switch, Splatoon 2 keeps selling well, Zelda and Mario Kart 8 still with amazing legs and Mario with the best FW for a 3D title.... Great week overall!Amazing performance Mario Odyssey. Looks like AC Origins did pretty well compared to prev entries (assuming not a huge diff between MC and Famitsu #s).Incredible Nintendo numbers. And praise YHVH for that Strange Journey debut!\\n\\nlobdale said:\\n\\n\\n\\nMan, it is not outside the realm of possibility that Switch could catch Wii U LTD by the end of the year.\\n\\nClick to expand...\\nClick to shrink...\\n\\nDid you have any doubt???Ark...what...?\\n\\ndarkside said:\\n\\n\\n\\nThose Ark sales seem completely insane?\\n\\nClick to expand...\\nClick to shrink...\\n\\n\\nYeah, what happened there?That’s a lottttt of switches!\\n\\n\",\n",

[3DS] Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey Redux # <RPG> (Atlus) {2017.10.26} (¥6.480) - 60.848 / NEW\\n\\nClick to expand...\\nClick to shrink...\\n\\n\\nWonderful.Huh, lower than announced (not counting digital sales I assume) but still higher than expected. Definitely higher than Galaxy 2 which was the highest selling 3D Mario until now and puts it much closer to the New Super Mario Bros releases.\\n\\nGreat success that also helped both Switch hardware and software. Wonder how did ARMS do?Splatoon, MK8, and Zelda all got a bump from Mario lolSoft start for Taiko PS4 but the series is known for crazy legs. If it can crawl to 100k then it’ll have been worth it.Good hw sales for the Switch, no comments regarding SMO since everything has been said already.MHXX on Switch bomba totalWow, who knew Ark was so big there?\\n\\nAktlys said:\\n\\n\\n\\nMHXX on Switch bomba total\\n\\nClick to expand...\\nClick to shrink...\\n\\n\\nLol what?\\n\\nGotdatmoney said:\\n\\n\\n\\nYeah, what happened there?\\n\\nClick to expand...\\nClick to shrink...\\n\\nI'm unfamiliar with Ark, are these good or bad numbers?Those GT Sport sales seem not good?\\n\\ndarkside said:\\n\\n\\n\\nThose Ark sales seem completely insane?\\n\\nClick to expand...\\nClick to shrink...\\n\\n\\nNot really, PUBG is over 300k in Japan and while not the exact same type of game, it targets more or less the same audience.Great job, Switch and Mario. Well deserved.There were some reports for SMO sell-put last week, so the discrepancy between MC and Famitsu could be explained by people buying download cards when they couldn't get a physical copy. Let's wait for the sell-through percentage to confirm.Switch 2 million. Great Mario numbers are still a bit deflating after the 500k Famitsu hype in the other MC thread. Holidays are gonna be fun.Good SMT sales in the end.PS4 with that stability upgrades. We doing 24k no matter what.\",\n",

Can we safely say that it’s over 1M WW?Geez, Mario and Splatoon got dem glutes\\n\\nLordKano said:\\n\\n\\n\\nPS4 will be down YTD.\\n\\nYo-Kai Watch confirm that Level-5 is as terrible as managing IPs as they always have been.\\n\\nClick to expand...\\nClick to shrink...\\n\\nhow much PS4 sold in Week 51 and 52?11./10.

Software sales are very healthy too.\\n\\nAre we expecting another rise for next week?To repeat myself from the other thread:\\n\\n\\nZedark said:\\n\\n\\n\\nMK8D over 50k, SMO over 130k, Splatoon 2 over 70, BOTW just under 20k, XBC2 with a rather mild 40% drop, and ARMS and Pokken over 10k. Great Switch numbers!\\n\\nClick to expand...\\nClick to shrink...\\n\\nYokai bomba, as expected.\\n\\nARMS being at 272k is amazing, 300k is an easy target, maybe 400k will be doable!\\n\\n\\nNSW] Super Mario Odyssey # <ACT> (Nintendo) {2017.10.27} (¥5.980) - 133.180 / 1.082.650 (+39%)\\n\\nClick to expand...\\nClick to shrink...\\n\\nThe game is still performing well as it just surpassed 1 million without counting the digital sales\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[PS4] Yakuza: Kiwami 2 # <ADV> (Sega) {2017.12.07} (¥7.590) - 26.650 / 158.581 (-80%)\\n\\nClick to expand...\\nClick to shrink...\\n\\nWas expecting more out of this oneSwitch entering beast mode in Japan.Switch will have 3 million sellers next week. Crazy. \\n\\nZelda might get there in another month, including Wii U and digital.ARMS is doing pretty well for a new IP. It certainly has potential to become a steady mid tier franchise for Nintendo with consistent 4 to 5 million worldwide sales. I think a sequel is all but guaranteed at this point.Switch passed the half way point to ps4's ltd.\\n\\nNoobie said:\\n\\n\\n\\nhow much PS4 sold in Week 51 and 52?\\n\\nClick to expand...\\nClick to shrink...\\n\\n\",\n",

Wow.\\n\\nRaijinto said:\\n\\n\\n\\nSo next week the Switch will pass 3 million and should just fall short or just beat the Wii U's LTD before the end of the year.\\n\\nVery impressive.\\n\\nAnd Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon are just selling like crazy lol.\\n\\nClick to expand...\\nClick to shrink...\\n\\n\\nYeah anecdotal reports are putting this next week at 300k+. Not sure what the ceiling is yet, but there have apparently been restocks far more often than in previous weeks.How much did the other Zelda titles sell in Japan? \\nAlso, one year to surpass WiiU's ltd, two years to surpass PS4's, four years to surpass 3DS'?Odyssey proving to be the main Switch title this December like I thought. It might push 200k+ next week. Splatoon is literally right on my trajectory I predicted out.\\n\\nPokemon continues to perform quite well in its own right. I was wrong about this 3rd version being a bridge to far for the franchise. I thought an off year would have really benefited the brand, but Nintendo proves me wrong with some easy money.How high can Switch go next week? Should be huge!\\n\\nPS4 down YoY likely, hopefully can bounce back.Switch doing great this holiday-season and probably going to continue with more stock available.\\n\\nImpressed with Odyssey's rise too!\\n\\nKillerMan91 said:\\n\\n\\n\\nPS4 needs to sell 125k units in two weeks to match last year. It will be probably practically a tie.\\n\\nClick to expand...\\nClick to shrink...\\n\\n\\nI think it will do around 70k next week and 40k the following week. Pretty close but still down despite the great first semester.\\n\\nDarkLordMalik said:\\n\\n\\n\\nSony messed up the holiday releases for PS4 in 2017. They had a great campaign and support last year.\\n\\nClick to expand...\\nClick to shrink...\\n\\n\\nIt's been years Sony has abandoned the holiday season. Yeah, last year we had FFXV and revisions but they didn't really have long-lasting impact. With PS4 form factor, Sony doesn't stand a chance in Japan, plus it doesn't have the audience to perform really well in December. Last platform that did well during holidays was PSP.\",\n",

Not bad at all. Week 52 will be a lot weaker though.Good numbers for software, a little bit less so for Switch hardware.Atelier bomba\\n\\nIdolmaster bombaMaybe next year (or whenever Pokemon launches) we'll get the insane holiday hardware sales we've all been dreaming of.\\n\\nSoftware is actually incredibly impressive though. 3 titles >1M within 10 months of launch.Disappointing week overall, but dem Nintendo legs for most SW though.\\nAlso interested to see the ratio for Atelier Vita and Switch since they didn't rank in the top 20.Yes MARIO kart 1 million :)))Switch hardware is disappointing, but those software sales are fantastic. Cool to see Dragon Ball still doing well too.1 2 Switch continues to disappoint.
